# FDE4NONMEM
The original Fractional Differential Equation Solver subroutine for the implementation of fractional non-linear mixed effects models in NONMEM. Developed by the Pharmacometrics group of the Department of Pharmacy of the National Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA). 
The repository consists of the following:
- FDEGL.f90: The FORTRAN subroutine
- FDEGL.m: The FDE numerical solver using the Grunwald-Letnikov Scheme written in MATLAB
- ControlFileTemplate.txt: A Control File Template for a Linear Model
- SIMDATA.txt: A Simulated dataset for running the Control File
- FDEGL_User_Guide.txt: A short user-manual
